<b>About us</b><br><br>
Researchers Exchange Participations is a platform for researchers to exchange participations.
<br><br>
The aim of this platform is to encourage researchers to participate in each others user studies. 
<br>
Moreover, recruiting serious participants has always been a burden on a researcher's shoulder, 
<br>thus, this platform gives researchers the opportunity to do that effectively and in a suitable
<br>time.
