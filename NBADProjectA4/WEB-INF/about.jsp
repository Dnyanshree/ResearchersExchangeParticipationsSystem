        Researchers Exchange Participations is a platform for researchers to exchange participations.
        <br><br>
        The aim of this platform is to encourage researchers to participate in each others user studies. 
        <br>
        Moreover, recruiting serious participants has always been a burden on a researcher's shoulder, 
        <br>thus, this platform gives researchers the opportunity to do that effectively and in a suitable
        <br>time.
